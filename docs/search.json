    "text": "Self Introduction Hi! I’m Cheryl. I’m a NUS undergraduate studying Sociology and Communications & New Media. This is my webpage for my NM2207 final project.\nTopic How do the characteristics of Taylor Swift’s music relate to her popularity?\nWhy Study This Topic?\n\n\nFigure 1: Taylor Swift performing at the Eras Tour.\n\nIt is undeniable that Taylor Swift has left a significant cultural impact in today’s society, evident not only through her numerous awards and Grammys, but also with her ongoing Eras Tour generating more than $5 billion (Music Expert Expounds on Taylor Swift’s Unmatched Cultural Impact, n.d.).\nAdditionally, she recently became the first person to receive the title of Person of the Year by Time Magazine for her achievement in the arts (ibid), underscoring her status as a cultural icon. Having been making music for almost 2 decades, a defining factor of her influence lies in the versatility of her music, where she started off her career with country music before transitioning to pop and indie folk genres (How Taylor Swift Masterminded Global Success, Explained by SOMD Experts | School of Music and Dance, n.d.).\nThus, examining the characteristics of her music throughout the years will provide an understanding about what led to this phenomenal success.\nThis leads us to the research question at hand: “How do the characteristics of Taylor Swift’s music relate to her popularity?” To do this, I created 2 types of data visualization:\n\nBar plots to measure the characteristics of her albums, utilizing the characteristics of (1) Danceability, (2) Acousticness, and (3) Tempo.\nBox plots to measure the popularity of her albums."

Danceability**** - How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. - Quantified a scale of 0.0 (least danceable) to 1.0 (most danceable).\n****2. Tempo**** - The speed or pace of a given piece. - Quantified through beats per minute (BPM).\n****3. Acousticness**** - A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. - Quantified on a scale of 0 (low confidence that the track is acoustic) to 1 (high confidence that the track is acoustic)."

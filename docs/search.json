EW.\n\n\nFigure 1: Taylor Swift performing her 'Red' era at the Eras Tour.\n\nIt is undeniable that Taylor Swift has left a significant cultural impact in today’s society, evident not only through her numerous awards and Grammys, but also with her ongoing Eras Tour generating more than $5 billion (Music Expert Expounds on Taylor Swift’s Unmatched Cultural Impact, n.d.).\nAdditionally, she recently became the first person to receive the title of Person of the Year by Time Magazine for her achievement in the arts (ibid), underscoring her status as a cultural icon. Having been making music for almost 2 decades, a defining factor of her influence lies in the versatility of her music, where she started off her career with country music before transitioning to pop and indie folk genres (How Taylor Swift Masterminded Global Success, Explained by SOMD Experts | School of Music and Dance, n.d.).\nThus, examining the characteristics of her music throughout the years will provide an understanding about what led to this phenomenal success.\n\n\nResearch Question\nThis leads us to the research question at hand: “How do the characteristics of Taylor Swift’s music relate to their popularity?” To do this, I created 2 types of data visualization:\n\nBar plots to measure the characteristics of her albums, utilizing the characteristics of (1) Danceability, (2) Acousticness, and (3) Tempo.\nBox plots to measure the popularity of her songs, sorted by each album."

Quantified a scale of 0.0 (least danceable) to 1.0 (most danceable).\n\n\n\nTempo: The speed or pace of a given piece. Quantified through beats per minute (BPM).\n\n\n\nAcousticness: A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic. Quantified on a scale of 0 (low confidence that the track is acoustic) to 1 (high confidence that the track is acoustic).\n\n\n\nPopularity of albums\nThe dataset presented provided the popularity of each song in her discography, quantified on a scale of 0 (least popular) to 100 (most popular). As each song was tagged to an album, a box plot is useful to show how the popularity data is distributed within each album, and if there are any outliers.\n\n\n\nFindings from data visualization\n\nDanceability\nThere is some variability in the albums’ danceability, with the highest danceability being 1989 (Taylor’s Version), followed by Midnights (Til The Dawn Edition), and Lover. On the other hand, Taylor Swift had the lowest level of danceability, followed by evermore (deluxe version) and folklore (deluxe version).\n\n\nAcousticness\nThere is great variability in the albums’ acousticness, with evermore (deluxe version) having the highest level of acousticness, followed by folklore (deluxe version) and Midnights (Til The Dawn Edition). Meanwhile, the rest of the albums exhibited lower levels of acousticness, especially that of 1989 (Taylor’s version), Red (Taylor’s Version), reputation, and Taylor Swift.\n\n\nTempo\nAll albums have relatively high levels of tempo, with the highest being Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and the lowest being Taylor Swift.\n\n\nPopularity\nThere is some variation in the popularity of each album. reputation has the highest median popularity, followed by Lover, while Taylor Swift has a much lower median popularity. The interquartile range is the highest in Lover, reputation, and Red (Taylor’s version), and the lowest in folklore (deluxe edition) and evermore (deluxe edition). Some of the albums have outliers, including evermore (deluxe version), Fearless (Taylor’s Version), Lover, and Taylor Swift.\n\n\n\nAnalysis of data visualization\n\nDanceability and Popularity\nAlbums with higher median popularity, such as reputation and Lover, tend to have higher levels of danceability, while albums with lower median popularity, such as Taylor Swift, have lower danceability. This could be because music of higher danceability levels appeal to a broader audeince, while those of lower danceability levels are more niche and are less mainstream amongst listeners.\n\n\nAcousticness and Popularity\nAlbums with a smaller interquartile range of popularity, such as folklore (deluxe version) and evermore (deluxe version), score higher in terms of level of acousticness. On the other hand, albums with a higher interquartile range of popularity, such as reputation and Red (Taylor’s Version), have lower levels of acousticness. A potential explanation is that different music of higher levels of acousticness tend to be enjoyed by the same audience due to the consistency in style, leading to a smaller interquartile range of popularity (i.e. the popularity of the songs do not vary so much). Meanwhile, music of lower levels of acousticness are not as consistent in how much they appeal to audiences, thus resulting in higher interquartile range of popularity (i.e. the popularity of the songs vary a lot).\n\n\nOverall\nOverall, the interplay between the characteristics of Swift’s music and their popularity is very complex, and while characteristics like danceability, acousticness, and tempo may influence the appeal and popularity of the album, they are not the sole determining factors, as other considerations, such as marketing strategies, time of release, and cultural relevance play a huge part as well. Nonetheless, it is important and interesting to consider how there may be some correlation between these characteristics and the popularity of her music."

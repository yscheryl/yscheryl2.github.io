**Analysis of Data Visualization:**

-   General acousticness: a large majority of her songs are between 0.00 and 0.27 on the acoustic scale, which is quitre low considering the scale is measured from 0.00 to 1.00.

-   Variability of acousticness within/across albums: generally varying levels of acousticness within and across albums, though some albums generally have more songs with higher levels of acousticness (e.g. folklore, evermore, Midnights), and some albums have more songs with lower levels of acousticness (e.g. Red, Fearless, Speak Now).

-   Acousticness and relation to time of release: her latest albums generally fall higher on the acoustic scale (e.g. folklore, evermore, Midnights) while her earliest albums have lower levels of acousticness (e.g. Red, Fearless, Speak Now).

**Analysis of Data Visualization:**

-   General danceability: her albums fall between 0.50 and 0.65 on the danceability scale, which is average considering the scale is measured from 0.00 to 1.00.

-   Variability of danceability within/across albums: range of average danceability values across the different albums, yet it appears that the differences aren't very large (and no outliers) which could indicate how within each album there are high and low levels of danceability.

-   Danceability levels and correlation to the time of release: her earliest albums and latest albums have the least average danceability (evermore, folklore, Taylor Swift, Fearless, Speak Now), while the albums released in the middle of her career thus far have the highest average levels of danceability (reputation, Lover, Red), with the exception of Midnights which has a relatively high level of danceability (greater than median) but is one of her latest albums.

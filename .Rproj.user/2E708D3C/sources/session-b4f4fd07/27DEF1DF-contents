## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
df1 <- read.csv("tsfeatures.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
df2 <- read.csv("tstracks.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")

df2 <- subset(df2, select = c("album_name", "release_date", "duration", "track_number", "popularity" ))

data <- merge(df1, df2, by = "album_name")
```

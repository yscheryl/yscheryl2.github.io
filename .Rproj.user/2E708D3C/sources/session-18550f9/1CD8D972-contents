**Choice of data visualization**

***Characteristics***
The dataset presented provided a number of music characteristics, of which I chose 3 defining characteristics to visualize her music.

****1. Danceability****
  - How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
  - Quantified a scale of 0.0 (least danceable) to 1.0 (most danceable).

****2. Tempo****
  - The speed or pace of a given piece.
  - Quantified through beats per minute (BPM).
  
****3. Acousticness****
  - A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.
  - Quantified on a scale of 0 (low confidence that the track is acoustic) to 1 (high confidence that the track is acoustic).

Danceability****\n  - How suitable a track is for dancing based on a combination of musical elements including tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.\n  - Quantified a scale of 0.0 (least danceable) to 1.0 (most danceable).\n\n****2. Tempo****\n  - The speed or pace of a given piece.\n  - Quantified through beats per minute (BPM).\n  \n****3. Acousticness****\n  - A confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic.\n  - Quantified on a scale of 0 (low confidence that the track is acoustic) to 1 (high confidence that the track is acoustic).",
